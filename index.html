                JavaScript
            </header>
            <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language used to make webpages interactive (e.g., having complex animations, clickable buttons, popup menus, etc.).  There are also more advanced server side versions of JavaScript such as Node.js, which allow you to add more functionality to a website than simply downloading files (such as realtime collaboration between multiple computers). Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
            <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as <code>Array</code>,<code>Date</code>, and <code>Math</code>, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.</li>
                <li>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This means that in the browser, JavaScript can change the way the webpage (DOM) looks. And, likewise, Node.js JavaScript on the server can respond to custom requests from code written in the browser.</p>

                JavaScript and Java
            </header>
            <p>JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.</p>
            <p>In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a small number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values. JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the more common class-based object model. The prototype-based model provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual objects. JavaScript also supports functions without any special declarative requirements. Functions can be properties of objects, executing as loosely typed methods.</p>
            <p>JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not have to declare all variables, classes, and methods. You do not have to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables, parameters, and function return types are not explicitly typed.</p>
            <p>Java is a class-based programming language designed for fast execution and type safety. Type safety means, for instance, that you can't cast a Java integer into an object reference or access private memory by corrupting Java bytecodes. Java's class-based model means that programs consist exclusively of classes and their methods. Java's class inheritance and strong typing generally require tightly coupled object hierarchies. These requirements make Java programming more complex than JavaScript programming.</p>
            <p>In contrast, JavaScript descends in spirit from a line of smaller, dynamically typed languages such as HyperTalk and dBASE. These scripting languages offer programming tools to a much wider audience because of their easier syntax, specialized built-in functionality, and minimal requirements for object creation.</p>
            <p>For more information on the differences between JavaScript and Java, see the chapter <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Details_of_the_Object_Model" target="_blank">Details of the object model</a>.</p>

                Getting Started With JavaScript
            </header>
            <p>Getting started with JavaScript is easy: all you need is a modern Web browser. This guide includes some JavaScript features which are only currently available in the latest versions of Firefox, so using the most recent version of Firefox is recommended.</p>
            <p>The <em>Web Console</em> tool built into Firefox is useful for experimenting with JavaScript; you can use it into two modes: single-line input mode, and multi-line input mode.</p>

            <header >
                Hello World
            </header>
            <p>To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Web Console in multi-line mode, and write your first "Hello world" JavaScript code:</p>
            <code>
                (function(){
                "use strict";
                /* Start of your code */
                function greetMe(yourName) {
                  alert('Hello ' + yourName);
                }
                
                greetMe('World');
                /* End of your code */
              })();
            </code>
            <p>Press <kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd> or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd> (or click the <strong>Run</strong> button) to watch it unfold in your browser!</p>

                Syntax Basics
            </header>
            <p>JavaScript borrows most of its syntax from Java, C, and C++, but it has also been influenced by Awk, Perl, and Python.</p>
            <p>JavaScript is <strong>case-sensitive</strong> and uses the <strong>Unicode</strong> character set. For example, the word Früh (which means "early" in German) could be used as a variable name.</p>
            <code>let Früh = "foobar"</code>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="declarations">
            <header>
                Declarations
            </header>
            <p>JavaScript has three kinds of variable declarations.</p>
            <code>var</code>
            <p>Declares a variable, optionally initializing it to a value.</p>
            <code>let</code>
            <p>Declares a block-scoped, local variable, optionally initializing it to a value.</p>
            <code>const</code>
            <p>Declares a block-scoped, read-only named constant.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="variables">
            <header>Variables</header>
            <p>You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.</p>
            <p>A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($). Subsequent characters can also be digits (0–9).</p>
            <p>Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) as well as "a" through "z" (lowercase).</p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="declaring_variables">
            <header>Declaring Variables</header>
            <p>You can declare a variable in two ways:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>With the keyword <code>var</code>. For example, <code>var x = 42</code>. This syntax can be used to declare both <strong>local</strong> and <strong>global</strong> variables, depending on the execution context.</li>
                <li>With the keyword <code>const</code> or <code>let</code>. For example, <code>let y = 13</code>. This syntax can be used to declare a block-scope local variable.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You can also simply assign a value to a variable For example, <code>x = 42</code>. This form creates an <strong>undeclared global</strong> variable. It also generates a strict JavaScript warning. Undeclared global variables can often lead to unexpected behavior. Thus, it is discouraged to use undeclared global variables.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="variable_scope">
            <header>Variable Scope</header>
            <p>When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a global variable, because it is available to any other code in the current document. When you declare a variable within a function, it is called a local variable, because it is available only within that function.</p>
            <p>JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement scope. Rather, a variable declared within a block is local to the function (or global scope) that the block resides within.</p>
            <p>For example, the following code will log <code>5</code>, because the scope of <code>x</code> is the global context (or the function context if the code is part of a function). The scope of <code>x</code> is not limited to the immediate <code>if</code> statement block.</p>
            <code>
                if (true) {
                    var x = 5;
                }
                console.log(x);  // x is 5
            </code>
            <p>This behavior changes when using the <code>let</code> declaration (introduced in ECMAScript 2015).</p>
            <code>
                if (true) {
                    let y = 5;
                  }
                console.log(y);  // ReferenceError: y is not defined
            </code>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="global_variables">
            <header>Global Variables</header>
            <p>Global variables are in fact properties of the global object.</p>
            <p>In web pages, the global object is <code>window</code>, so you can set and access global variables using the <code>window.variable</code> syntax.</p>
            <p>Consequently, you can access global variables declared in one window or frame from another <code>window</code> or <code>frame</code> by specifying the window or frame name. For example, if a variable called <code>phoneNumber</code> is declared in a document, you can refer to this variable from an <code>iframe</code> as <code>parent.phoneNumber</code>.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="constants">
            <header>Constants</header>
            <p>You can create a read-only, named constant with the <code>const</code> keyword.</p>
            <p>The syntax of a constant identifier is the same as any variable identifier: it must start with a letter, underscore, or dollar sign ($), and can contain alphabetic, numeric, or underscore characters.</p>
            <code>const PI = 3.14;</code>
            <p>A constant cannot change value through assignment or be re-declared while the script is running. It must be initialized to a value.</p>
            <p>The scope rules for constants are the same as those for <code>let</code> block-scope variables. If the <code>const</code> keyword is omitted, the identifier is assumed to represent a variable.</p>
            <p>You cannot declare a constant with the same name as a function or variable in the same scope. For example:</p>
            <code>// THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR
                function f() {};
                const f = 5;
                
                // THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR TOO
                function f() {
                  const g = 5;
                  var g;
                
                  //statements
                }</code>
            <p>However, the properties of objects assigned to constants are not protected, so the following statement is executed without problems.</p>
            <code>const MY_OBJECT = {'key': 'value'};
                MY_OBJECT.key = 'otherValue';</code>
            <p>Also, the contents of an array are not protected, so the following statement is executed without problems.</p>
            <code>const MY_ARRAY = ['HTML','CSS'];
                MY_ARRAY.push('JAVASCRIPT');
                console.log(MY_ARRAY); //logs ['HTML','CSS','JAVASCRIPT'];</code>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="data_types">
            <header>Data Types</header>
            <p>The latest ECMAScript standard defines eight data types:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Seven data types that are primitives:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Boolean.<code>true</code> and <cod>false</cod>.</li>
                        <li>null. A special keyword denoting a null value. (Because JavaScript is case-sensitive, <code>null</code> is not the same as <code>Null</code>, <code>NULL</code>, or any other variant.)</li>
                        <li>undefined. A top-level property whose value is not defined.</li>
                        <li>Number. An integer or floating point number. For example: <code>42</code> or <code>3.14159</code>.</li>
                        <li>BigInt. An integer with arbitrary precision. For example: <code>9007199254740992n</code>.</li>
                        <li>String. A sequence of characters that represent a text value. For example: "Howdy"</li>
                        <li>Symbol (new in ECMAScript 2015). A data type whose instances are unique and immutable.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>and Object</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Although these data types are relatively few, they enable you to perform useful functions with your applications. Objects and functions are the other fundamental elements in the language. You can think of objects as named containers for values, and functions as procedures that your script can perform.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="if_else_statement">
            <header>if...else Statement</header>
            <p>Use the <code>if</code> statement to execute a statement if a logical condition is <code>true</code>. Use the optional <code>else</code> clause to execute a statement if the condition is <code>false</code>.</p>
            <p>An <code>if</code> statement looks like this:</p>
            <code>
                if (condition) {
                statement_1;
              } else {
                statement_2;
              }
            </code>
            <p>Here, the <code>condition</code> can be any expression that evaluates to <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>.</p>
            <p>If <code>condition</code> evaluates to <code>true</code>, <code>statement_1</code> is executed. Otherwise, <code>statement_2</code> is executed. <code>statement_1</code> and <code>statement_2</code> can be any statement, including further nested <code>if</code> statements.</p>
            <p>You can also compound the statements using <code>else if</code> to have multiple conditions tested in sequence, as follows:</p>
            <code>
                if (condition_1) {
                    statement_1;
                  } else if (condition_2) {
                    statement_2;
                  } else if (condition_n) {
                    statement_n;
                  } else {
                    statement_last;
                  } 
            </code>

        <section class="main-section" id="loops">
            <header>Loops</header>
            <p>Loops offer a quick and easy way to do something repeatedly.</p>
            <p>You can think of a loop as a computerized version of the game where you tell someone to take X steps in one direction, then Y steps in another. For example, the idea "Go five steps to the east" could be expressed this way as a loop:</p>
            <code>
                for (let step = 0; step &lt; 5; step++) {
                    // Runs 5 times, with values of step 0 through 4.
                    console.log('Walking east one step');
                  }
            </code>
            <p>There are many different kinds of loops, but they all essentially do the same thing: they repeat an action some number of times. (Note that it's possible that number could be zero!)</p>
            <p>The various loop mechanisms offer different ways to determine the start and end points of the loop. There are various situations that are more easily served by one type of loop over the others.</p>
            <p>The statements for loops provided in JavaScript are:</p>

            <p>A <strong>function definition</strong> (also called a <strong>function declaration</strong>, or <strong>function statement</strong>) consists of the <code>function</code> keyword, followed by:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The name of the function</li>
                <li>A list of parameters to the function,enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas.</li>
                <li>the JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly brackets, <code>{...}</code></li>
            </ul>
            <p>For example, the following code defines a simple function named <code>square</code>:</p>
            <code>
                function square(number) {
                    return number * number;
                  }
            </code>
            <p>The function <code>square</code> takes one parameter, called <code>number</code>. The function consists of one statement that says to return the parameter of the function (that is, <code>number</code>) multiplied by itself. The statement <code>return</code> specifies the value returned by the function:</p>
            <code>
                return number * number;
            </code>
            <p>Primitive parameters (such as a number) are passed to functions <strong>by value</strong>; the value is passed to the function, but if the function changes the value of the parameter,<strong> this change is not reflected globally or in the calling function</strong>.</p>
            <p>If you pass an object (i.e. a non-primitive value, such as <code>Array</code> or a user-defined object) as a parameter and the function changes the object's properties, that change is visible outside the function, as shown in the following example:</p>
            <code>
                function myFunc(theObject) {
                    theObject.make = 'Toyota';
                  }
                  
                  var mycar = {make: 'Honda', model: 'Accord', year: 1998};
                  var x, y;
                  
                  x = mycar.make; // x gets the value "Honda"
                  
                  myFunc(mycar);
                  y = mycar.make; // y gets the value "Toyota"
                                  // (the make property was changed by the function)
            </code>
